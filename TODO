Load kernel as ELF and implement dladdr()/backtrace()
(-z max-page-size=0x1000)

Write AML parse to read SDST ACPI tables
Enable multicore
Locks for hardware access eg PIC
write printf and print()
PS/2 mouse fixes generate own interrupt, seperate data streams
MOSTLY DONE fix keyboard scan codes and full scan code
# Try out compile flags:
-finline-small-functions
-findirect-inlining
-ffreestanding

Reduce the number of global values and functions
Add MemoryManager and TaskManager classes.
Add Resource manager for i/o ports and mmio
Shrink down boot16to64.bin
Better setup of initial mapping to not waste physical page for guardpage
Merge kernel.h and klibc.h

use struct/class more consistenly and fixup what should be singletons etc
    DONE - convert device drivers to all be classes
    CPU & Bootparams still needs fixing

Dont bother setting up the extra GDT/TSS in GDT.swift just do it once in
     the config page at the front of the kernel and remove dupliace code
     from BIOS and EFI setup asm.

     24367fa5d91ab90641adaef48759c9fd8e4059bb
DONE Recompile with -mcmodel=kernel incl swift and relink kernel to
     negative address space

DONE fix interrupt masking / timer overrun
DONE Add exception and IRQ ISTs - Inital IST
DONE Add System and InterruptManager classes.
DONE Remove the sharedInstance of APIC, KBD8042, PIC8259 and PIT8254
     and add as instances to System and/or InterruptManager.
DONE Replace bitSet() functions with subscripts where necessary
