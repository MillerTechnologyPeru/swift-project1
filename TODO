ACPI: Implement method executation
ACPI: Setup devices found in tables
ACPI: Setup acpi as a device
Load kernel as ELF and implement dladdr()/backtrace() (-z max-page-size=0x1000)
Fix string sorting for ASCII / Decide on libicu stub
Add MemoryManager and TaskManager classes.
Add Resource manager for i/o ports and mmio
IOAPIC: PCI interrupt routing
Reduce the number of global values and functions
Better setup of initial mapping to not waste physical page for guardpage
Locks for hardware access eg PIC
Enable multicore
MOSTLY DONE fix keyboard scan codes and full scan code
Shrink down boot16to64.bin
use struct/class more consistenly and fixup what should be singletons etc
    DONE - convert device drivers to all be classes
    CPU &
    DONE Bootparams still needs fixing

MAYBE Implement malloc() in swift


DONE Write AML parser to read SDST ACPI tables
WONTDO Merge kernel.h and klibc.h
DONE Dont bother setting up the extra GDT/TSS in GDT.swift just do it once in the config page at the front of the kernel and remove duplicate code from BIOS and EFI setup asm.
DONE Interrupt done, need to seperate data - PS/2 mouse fixes generate own interrupt, seperate data streams
DONE Find DMI system ID
DONE Determine Frame buffer
DONE Draw on screen
DONE Add simple Graphics Console / fonts
DONE Update efi-header
DONE ExitBootServices()
DONE keyboard
DONE add function overrider for putchar_unlocked
DONE write patcher for EFI header
DONE add early_tty swift driver
DONE replace isohdppx.bin with own code and move to lib/
DONE add EFIBootParams
DONE fix debug build (stack issue)
DONE add stack over/under flow detector
DONE and exveption ISTs
DONE Move to highmem used for kernel space, nb: PR  #7732
     24367fa5d91ab90641adaef48759c9fd8e4059bb
DONE Recompile with -mcmodel=kernel incl swift and relink kernel to
     negative address space
DONE fix interrupt masking / timer overrun
DONE Add exception and IRQ ISTs - Inital IST
DONE Add System and InterruptManager classes.
DONE Remove the sharedInstance of APIC, KBD8042, PIC8259 and PIT8254
     and add as instances to System and/or InterruptManager.
DONE Replace bitSet() functions with subscripts where necessary
DONE # Try out compile flags: -finline-small-functions -findirect-inlining -ffreestanding
