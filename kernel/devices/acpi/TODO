Use IOPort and MMapped regions for the RegionSpace, only use arrays for testing
Make error messaging better
Max subparser recursion depth
Simplify parseArgs etc and merge with Var args
Scope modifiers dont need to store the objectList
Store local names in the context not the globalObjects


- Fix RegionSpace read/write at bitOffset
- merge If/ElseIf/ElseIf/Else blocks
- Fix dual invokeMethods, should only be one
- AMLDefOpRegion Should probably be a class and try to allocate its own region at init()
- Fix enums to have lowercase first letter


DONE tidy up current parsing,
DONE use nextSymbol more
DONE rename amlopcodes to amltypes
DONE remove default in switch
DONE - Avoid default case in switch as reduces validation of any new cases added
DONE - switch/case for tables as created at compile time with extra checking and optimistion
DONE - NotOp needs to take a second opcode as a param - Why?? - ITs the Target!!
DONE - Need to deal with generic TermArg since its used for specifci types (=> Integer)
DONE Expand names re Scope
DONE TermArg return type Integer, String etc
