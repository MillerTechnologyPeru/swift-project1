Use IOPort and MMapped regions for the RegionSpace, only use arrays for testing
Make error messaging better
Max subparser recursion depth
Simplify parseArgs etc and merge with Var args
Scope modifiers dont need to store the objectList
Store local names in the context not the globalObjects


- Fix RegionSpace read/write at bitOffset
- merge If/ElseIf/ElseIf/Else blocks
- Fix dual invokeMethods, should only be one
- AMLDefOpRegion Should probably be a class and try to allocate its own region at init()
- Fix enums to have lowercase first letter
